# Crop-Yield-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A project which predicts crop yield on the basis of different factors using machine learning model for prediction with  best accuracy and peformance. A frontend website is created for easy usabiliy of the model which takes different variables affecting yield as input and gives output as the target variable which is crop yield.
