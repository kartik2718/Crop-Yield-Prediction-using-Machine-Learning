# Crop-Yield-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A project which predicts crop yield on the basis of different factors using machine learning model for prediction with  best accuracy and peformance. A frontend website is created for easy usabiliy of the model which takes different variables affecting yield as input and gives output as the target variable which is crop yield. The repository for the project containts html file for frontend website as index.html and flask code for integrating the machine learning model prediction into the frontend website as app.py(tempcoderunnerfile.py). 
dtr.pkl and preprocessor.pkl are the pickle files imported from ipynb file to the flask code and yield_df.csv is the dataset used for prediction.
crop_yield_prediction is the ipynb file which contains the code for data analysis of the dataset and machine learning model for prediction of crop yield.
